## Data Collection
**Which Data?**<br />

**Helpful Data**<br />

* Yelp API: Stores, Parks, Vets.
* Population and household Income.<br />

**Not So Much**
* Explicit ownership
* Price points

It is important to go through the data once you collect it to see which is helpful for answering your question. Once the data has been filtered down to what you need you should do some basic analysis of it to see what factors there are and what you should comapre it to.

In the above graph we are comparing volume of stores in each area (Queens, Manhattan) in order to see if one are has a lot of pet stores and a low number of vets/dog parks. This will help give us an idea to the data needed. In this case we used Pet Stores and Vets and dropped dog parks since there were more vets in total. The reason we went with vets is because we found that there is a more likley chance of pet owners near vets.
